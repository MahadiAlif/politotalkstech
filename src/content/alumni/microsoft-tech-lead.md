Five years ago, I walked across the stage at Politecnico di Torino with my Computer Engineering degree, uncertain about what the future held. Today, as I write this from my office in Redmond, I can say with confidence that the journey has been incredible, challenging, and far more rewarding than I ever imagined.

## The Early Years

My path to Microsoft wasn't linear. After graduation, I spent two years at a startup in Milan, learning the fundamentals of software architecture and team collaboration. The experience taught me that technical skills alone aren't enough. Communication, empathy, and leadership are equally important.

The startup environment was intense but valuable. I learned to:

- Ship code quickly while maintaining quality
- Work with ambiguous requirements
- Collaborate across multiple teams
- Take ownership of entire features

## Joining Microsoft

Joining Microsoft in 2022 was a dream come true, but also intimidating. The scale and complexity of the systems I now work on dwarf anything I encountered during university. However, the solid foundation I received at Polito, particularly in algorithms, system design, and problem-solving, proved invaluable.

My first year involved:

- Ramping up on Microsoft's internal tools and processes
- Contributing to production systems handling millions of requests
- Learning from senior engineers with decades of experience
- Understanding the importance of code quality at scale

## Becoming a Tech Lead

As a Tech Lead, I now mentor junior developers, make architectural decisions, and coordinate between multiple teams. The leadership skills I developed through PolitoTalksTech activities have been crucial in this role.

Key responsibilities include:

- Technical design and architecture reviews
- Mentoring team members on best practices
- Cross-team coordination and communication
- Balancing technical debt with new features

## Lessons Learned

Looking back, several lessons stand out:

**Fundamentals Matter**: The algorithms and data structures courses from Polito might have seemed theoretical, but they're essential for solving real-world problems at scale.

**Continuous Learning**: Technology evolves rapidly. Dedicate time to learning new tools, languages, and paradigms. The learning mindset you develop at university should never stop.

**Soft Skills Are Critical**: Being able to explain technical concepts clearly, work collaboratively, and lead with empathy matters as much as coding ability.

**Ownership Drives Growth**: Take ownership of projects beyond your assigned tasks. Initiative and accountability accelerate career growth.

## Advice for Current Students

For students currently at Polito:

- Build projects beyond coursework. Real experience matters.
- Contribute to open source. It builds skills and visibility.
- Network actively. Many opportunities come through connections.
- Don't chase the biggest companies initially. Learning environment matters more.
- Develop communication skills alongside technical skills.

## Looking Forward

The technology industry offers incredible opportunities for those willing to learn and adapt. Whether you end up at a large company like Microsoft, a startup, or building your own venture, the education and experiences at Polito provide a strong foundation for success.

The journey from student to tech lead has been challenging but deeply rewarding. I'm excited to see where the next five years take me, and I'm grateful for the foundation that Politecnico di Torino provided.
