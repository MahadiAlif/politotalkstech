Completing a PhD in Energy Engineering at Politecnico was just the beginning of my journey. While many of my peers continued in academia, I chose to take my research expertise into industry, specifically to Tesla's Energy division. Here's how I made that transition and what I learned along the way.

## The Academic Foundation

My doctoral research focused on optimization algorithms for distributed energy storage systems. The work was theoretical but had clear practical applications in grid-scale battery deployment and residential energy management.

Key research areas:

- Battery management system optimization
- Grid integration of renewable energy
- Predictive algorithms for energy demand
- Cost-benefit analysis of storage deployment

## The Decision to Leave Academia

During my PhD, I realized that while I enjoyed research, I wanted more direct impact on real-world energy systems. Academic publishing timelines meant years between discovery and implementation. I wanted to see my work deployed at scale.

Factors in my decision:

- Desire for faster iteration and implementation
- Interest in cross-functional collaboration
- Opportunity to work on deployed systems
- Better work-life balance than academic track

## Transitioning to Industry

The transition wasn't straightforward. PhD holders often face misconceptions:

- "Too theoretical for practical work"
- "Overqualified for entry positions"
- "Won't stay long-term"
- "Lack business understanding"

I addressed these by:

- Highlighting practical aspects of my research
- Demonstrating business acumen through case studies
- Showing long-term commitment to energy industry
- Emphasizing cross-functional collaboration skills

## Discovering Product Management

Product management wasn't on my radar during my PhD. I discovered the role through:

- Informational interviews with Tesla employees
- Understanding how technical decisions get made
- Learning about the intersection of technology and business
- Recognizing that PM skills aligned with my interests

Product management appealed because it combines:

- Technical depth with business strategy
- Research mindset with execution focus
- Cross-functional leadership
- Direct impact on product development

## Joining Tesla Energy

I joined Tesla's Energy division as a Product Manager for their Powerwall and Megapack products. My PhD background proved valuable for:

- Understanding technical tradeoffs in battery systems
- Communicating with engineering teams
- Evaluating new technologies and partnerships
- Making data-driven product decisions

## Day-to-Day Responsibilities

As a Senior PM, my work includes:

- Defining product roadmaps for energy storage products
- Working with engineering on technical specifications
- Analyzing market trends and competitive landscape
- Coordinating launches across multiple teams
- Engaging with utility partners and customers

## Skills from PhD That Transfer

Research skills that proved valuable:

**Critical Thinking**: Evaluating complex problems systematically

**Data Analysis**: Making decisions based on rigorous analysis

**Communication**: Explaining complex technical concepts clearly

**Project Management**: Managing long-term, ambiguous projects

**Learning Agility**: Quickly mastering new domains

## Skills I Had to Develop

New skills required for PM role:

- Business strategy and market analysis
- Stakeholder management across organizations
- Rapid decision-making with incomplete information
- Negotiation and influence without authority
- Agile development methodologies

## Impact and Fulfillment

Working at Tesla allows me to:

- See my work deployed in thousands of installations
- Contribute to accelerating sustainable energy adoption
- Work with world-class teams
- Iterate quickly based on real customer feedback

The impact is tangible. Products I've worked on are:

- Storing gigawatt-hours of renewable energy
- Reducing carbon emissions globally
- Enabling grid stability with renewable integration
- Making clean energy economically viable

## Advice for PhD Students

For current PhD students considering industry:

**Your Research Skills Transfer**: Critical thinking and analysis are valuable everywhere.

**Broaden Your Perspective**: Take courses in business, product, and communication.

**Network Actively**: Talk to people in industry roles that interest you.

**Gain Practical Experience**: Internships or consulting projects help bridge the gap.

**Be Open to Non-Traditional Paths**: Your PhD prepares you for more than just academic or research roles.

## Looking Ahead

The energy transition is accelerating, and there's never been a better time to work on clean energy technology. Whether you pursue academia, industry research, or product roles, your technical expertise is valuable.

For me, product management at Tesla provides the perfect blend of technical depth, business impact, and mission-driven work. The PhD wasn't a detour; it was essential preparation for the work I do today.

The path from research to product isn't always obvious, but for those interested in both technical depth and practical impact, it's worth exploring.
