When my co-founder and I started working on our university capstone project in 2019, we had no idea it would eventually become one of Europe's fastest-growing fintech startups. Three years later, after raising €50M in Series B funding, I want to share our journey and the lessons learned along the way.

## The Beginning: A Class Project

It started innocently enough. For our final project in the Management Engineering program, my team was tasked with identifying inefficiencies in traditional business processes. We focused on B2B payments, specifically the pain points small businesses face with invoice processing and cash flow management.

What we discovered:

- Small businesses wait an average of 60 days for invoice payments
- Manual processing leads to errors and delays
- Cash flow uncertainty prevents growth investments
- Existing solutions were too expensive or complex

## From Project to Prototype

After graduation, while my classmates joined consulting firms and large corporations, my co-founder Marco and I decided to spend three months building a working prototype. We lived off savings and worked from my parents' garage.

The prototype focused on:

- Automated invoice processing using ML
- Instant payment options for suppliers
- Transparent fee structure
- Simple integration with existing accounting software

## First Customer and Validation

Our first customer was a small manufacturing company in Turin. They agreed to pilot our solution for free. Within three months, they reduced their invoice processing time by 70 percent and improved cash flow visibility significantly.

That success led to:

- Five more pilot customers through referrals
- Refinement of our product based on real feedback
- Understanding of our target market's true needs
- Confidence to pursue this full-time

## Raising Our Seed Round

Fundraising was challenging. As first-time founders with no track record, we faced skepticism. We pitched to over 50 investors before securing our €2M seed round from a Milan-based VC fund.

Key lessons from fundraising:

- Traction matters more than ideas
- Know your metrics inside and out
- Build relationships before you need money
- Persistence pays off

## Scaling Challenges

With funding in place, we faced new challenges:

- Hiring our first employees
- Building scalable infrastructure
- Regulatory compliance in fintech
- Maintaining company culture during rapid growth

## Series A and European Expansion

Our Series A round of €15M in 2023 enabled European expansion. We launched in Germany, France, and Spain, adapting our product to local regulations and business practices.

Growth metrics that impressed investors:

- 300 percent year-over-year revenue growth
- 95 percent customer retention rate
- Processing over €500M in transactions
- Team growth from 8 to 45 people

## Series B and Current State

Our recent Series B of €50M will fund:

- Product expansion into additional financial services
- AI-powered features for predictive cash flow
- Geographic expansion to Scandinavia
- Team growth to 150 people

## The Role of Polito

My education at Politecnico was crucial:

- Management engineering provided business and technical knowledge
- Project-based learning taught practical problem-solving
- Networking with classmates created future opportunities
- Access to professors as advisors and mentors

## Advice for Aspiring Entrepreneurs

For students considering entrepreneurship:

**Start Before You're Ready**: Don't wait for the perfect idea. Start solving real problems.

**Build Something People Want**: Talk to potential customers constantly. Build for their needs, not your assumptions.

**Find the Right Co-founder**: Choose someone with complementary skills and shared values. Founding teams break up more often than marriages.

**Embrace Uncertainty**: Startups are unpredictable. Comfort with ambiguity is essential.

**Take Care of Yourself**: Burnout is real. Build sustainable work habits from the start.

## Looking Forward

We're still in the early chapters of PayFlow's story. The goal isn't just building a successful company, but creating lasting value for our customers and team members.

For current students: The path from university project to funded startup isn't easy, but it's possible. Focus on solving real problems, build incrementally, and don't be afraid to take calculated risks.

The journey has been challenging, exhausting, and absolutely worth it.
