The Web Development & Design Collective is the largest web-focused community at Politecnico. We bring together students interested in building modern web applications, from frontend design to backend architecture.

## Learning Tracks

We offer structured learning paths for different interests:

- Frontend development with React, Vue, and modern JavaScript
- Backend development with Node.js, Python, and databases
- Full-stack development combining both areas
- UI/UX design principles and tools

## Collaborative Projects

Members work together on:

- Open source contributions
- Client projects for student organizations
- Personal portfolio development
- Full-stack applications

## Code Review and Mentorship

Our mentorship program pairs experienced members with beginners for:

- One-on-one code reviews
- Project guidance and architecture decisions
- Career advice and portfolio building
- Interview preparation

## Tech Talks and Showcases

Regular events feature:

- Member project demonstrations
- Industry speakers on current trends
- Deep dives into specific technologies
- Best practices and design patterns

## Community Projects

We maintain several open source projects that serve both as learning resources and useful tools for the student community.
