- Forensics and incident response

## Training and Workshops

Regular workshops cover:

- Penetration testing methodologies
- Security tool usage and development
- Vulnerability research techniques
- Secure coding practices
- Defensive security measures

## Practical Projects

Members work on real security projects including:

- Security audits of campus systems
