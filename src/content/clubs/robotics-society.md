The Robotics & Automation Society is where mechanical engineering meets computer science. We design, build, and program autonomous robots while exploring the latest in robotics technology.

## Competition Teams

We maintain active teams for:

- RoboCup autonomous robot soccer
- Eurobot engineering competition
- Autonomous vehicle challenges
- Custom design competitions

## Project Areas

Members work on diverse projects including:

- Mobile robots and navigation systems
- Robotic manipulation and grasping
- Computer vision for robotics
- Sensor fusion and perception
- Control systems and planning

## Facilities and Equipment

Our lab provides access to:

- 3D printers and fabrication tools
- Electronics workbenches
- Robot platforms and components
- Testing areas for autonomous systems

## Workshops and Training

Regular workshops cover:

- ROS (Robot Operating System)
- Computer vision techniques
- Control theory fundamentals
- Mechanical design for robotics
- Embedded systems programming

## Industry and Research Connections

We collaborate with:

- Robotics research labs
- Industrial automation companies
- Autonomous vehicle startups
- Manufacturing partners

## Multidisciplinary Collaboration

Our club brings together students from mechanical engineering, computer science, electrical engineering, and other fields to work on complex robotic systems.
