The AI & Machine Learning Society is the largest technical club at Politecnico di Torino focused on artificial intelligence and machine learning. We bring together students passionate about understanding and building intelligent systems.

## What We Do

Our activities span the spectrum from theoretical foundations to practical applications. Weekly meetings feature hands-on coding sessions where members work on real datasets and implement algorithms from scratch. We regularly host guest speakers from industry and academia who share insights about cutting-edge research and real-world AI applications.

## Learning Opportunities

Members have access to:

- Structured learning paths from beginner to advanced topics
- Collaborative projects with peer code reviews
- Competition teams for Kaggle and other ML challenges
- Research paper reading groups
- Access to GPU computing resources

## Community and Networking

Beyond technical skills, we foster a supportive community where members can:

- Find study groups and project collaborators
- Connect with alumni working in AI/ML roles
- Learn about internship and career opportunities
- Present their own projects and research

## Getting Involved

We welcome students from all backgrounds and experience levels. Whether you're just starting to learn about AI or you're already working on research projects, there's a place for you in our community.
