Our AR Campus Navigation System revolutionizes how students explore and navigate the Politecnico campus. Using cutting-edge augmented reality technology, the app overlays digital information onto the real world, making it easier than ever to find classrooms, labs, and facilities.

## Development Process

The development process involved extensive research into indoor positioning systems, AR frameworks, and user experience design. We implemented a hybrid approach using Bluetooth beacons and WiFi triangulation for precise location tracking, combined with ARCore for seamless augmented reality experiences.

## Key Features

- Real-time indoor positioning using Bluetooth beacons and WiFi triangulation
- AR waypoints and navigation overlays
- Room finder functionality
- Accessibility routes for students with disabilities
- Integration with campus facilities database

## Technical Implementation

The system uses React Native for cross-platform mobile development, ARCore for augmented reality features, and a Node.js backend with MongoDB for data management. Real-time positioning data is processed through Firebase for instant updates.

## Impact

The app has been downloaded over 3,000 times and maintains a 4.8-star rating on app stores, significantly improving campus navigation for new and current students.
