The AI-Powered Study Buddy Chatbot leverages natural language processing to provide intelligent academic support to students. It can answer questions about course materials, suggest study plans, and provide explanations for complex topics.

## Core Capabilities

The chatbot assists students with:

- Answering questions about course content and concepts
- Generating personalized study schedules
- Providing step-by-step explanations for problems
- Recommending relevant resources and materials
- Tracking study progress and suggesting focus areas

## Technical Implementation

We built the system using a combination of technologies:

- OpenAI GPT for natural language understanding and generation
- FastAPI backend for efficient API handling
- React frontend for intuitive user interaction
- PostgreSQL database for storing conversation history and user preferences

## Personalization Features

The chatbot adapts to individual learning styles by:

- Analyzing conversation patterns and learning preferences
- Adjusting explanation complexity based on user feedback
- Remembering previous topics and building on them
- Providing examples tailored to the student's major

## Privacy and Ethics

We prioritized student privacy throughout the design:

- All data is encrypted and stored securely
- Students control their data and can delete it anytime
- The system does not share information with instructors
- Clear guidelines prevent academic dishonesty

## Impact and Adoption

Over 500 students use the platform regularly, reporting improved understanding of course material and better study habits. We continue to refine the system based on user feedback.
