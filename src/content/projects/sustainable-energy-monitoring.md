Our Sustainable Energy Monitoring Platform addresses the critical need for energy efficiency in university buildings. Using a network of IoT sensors and smart meters, we collect real-time data on electricity, heating, and cooling consumption across multiple campus facilities.

## System Architecture

The platform consists of distributed sensor nodes deployed throughout campus buildings, a centralized data collection system, and a web-based analytics dashboard. Each sensor node transmits data via LoRaWAN to minimize power consumption and maximize range.

## Data Collection and Analysis

We monitor multiple parameters including:

- Electricity consumption by zone and time of day
- Heating and cooling system performance
- Natural light availability and artificial lighting usage
- Occupancy patterns correlated with energy use

## Optimization Recommendations

The system provides actionable insights to facilities management:

- Identifying inefficient equipment and suggesting replacements
- Optimizing HVAC schedules based on occupancy patterns
- Detecting anomalies that indicate equipment malfunction
- Tracking progress toward sustainability goals

## Results

Initial deployment across three campus buildings has demonstrated a 15 percent reduction in energy consumption and identified several equipment inefficiencies that were promptly addressed.
